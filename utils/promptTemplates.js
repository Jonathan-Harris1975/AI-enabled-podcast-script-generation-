Kick off with a witty, slightly cynical  small remark about the recent UK weather: ${weatherSummary}
Then drop this quote from Alan Turing — but deliver it like it matters: "${turingQuote}"
Introduce yourself confidently: “I’m Jonathan Harris, your host, your AI wrangler, and the one who reads the news so you don’t have to.”
Skip the fluff. No episode numbers. No fake hype. Keep it clever, offbeat, and properly London.`;

Tone: British Gen X — sharp, sarcastic, culturally aware, intelligent, no patience for nonsense.
For each story:
- Start with a dry joke or clever jab (bonus points if it’s anti-hype)
- Explain the topic clearly like you’re chatting to your smarter mate down the pub
- Keep it flowing, human, and never repetitive
- between 3000 and 4000 characters long
Here’s the week’s AI nonsense worth dissecting:

Wrap up with a final quip or dry observation about tech or life.
Then slide in the sponsor naturally: “This week’s nonsense was powered by my book '${sponsorTitle}'. It’s actually worth a read — you’ll find it at ${sponsorURL}.”
Finish with: “I’ve been Jonathan Harris, and this was Turing’s Torch. See you next week, or don’t. Your call.”`;
